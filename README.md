# :ocean: The Ocean Static HTML Blog Website

This is a simple, clean blog site built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
Itâ€™s based on a Photoshop mockup called [Ocean â€“ Personal Blog Template for Travelers and Dreamers](https://themeforest.net/item/ocean-personal-blog-template-for-travelers-and-dreamers-/15702539), purchased from Envato/ThemeForest.

The goal of this project is to turn a static design into accessible, modern code â€” and make it easy for anyone to customize or learn from.  
Itâ€™s mobile responsive and includes a custom CSS masonry layout for the blog archive, which Iâ€™m especially proud of.

_This project is part of a free, open-source series focused on helping newer developers practice HTML/CSS with real-world examples._
