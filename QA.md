# QA Testing

-   navigation needs "You Are Here" link underline
-   Weird top border inside the blog author box
-   Spacing above the date in Related Posts section
-   consider more CSS refactoring and make a scss partial for typography and headings
-   update the date divs to <time> element
-   fix awkward spacing after title on full_width layout
-   need to adjust spacing/flexbox for blog meta comment count, tags and social icons
-   mobile spacing for header needs to be tightened up
-   check the border styles on the category - not specific enough
-   are you reusing the 'full_width' class name by mistake? DONE
-   rethink the CSS structure strategy so layouts aren't tied to really specific types of pages
-   layout styles are templates, not pages like about or contact
-   update the page title and descriptions
-   make an svg signature
-   need clamp() for .secondary-heading font-size
